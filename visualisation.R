# First, set the correct Working Directory. (write your code in the line below)

setwd()

# Next, we are creating a new vector
data <- c("cold", "normal", "hot", "very hot", "hot", "hot", "hot", "cold", "normal", "very cold", "cold","normal","very cold", "hot", "normal", "hot", "normal", "cold", "hot", "hot")

# For the following tasks please always write the code below the comment with the instructions, example:
#
# Print out the data vector
data

# Now it's your turn:
#
# Produce a frequency distribution table for the data vector and print out this table


# Plot a bar chart. Make it more presentable by labelling it properly. The bars should be ordered from very cold to very hot.


# Plot a 3D pie chart. Make it more presentable by labelling it properly. The slices should be ordered from very cold to very hot.


# That's all. Don't forget to push your commit.
# Just a reminder that you have to work on this task by yourself. If students submit a similar solution it will be easy to find out in GitHub which student pushed their commit first.
